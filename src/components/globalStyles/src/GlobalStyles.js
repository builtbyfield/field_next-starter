       *    We used to set this in the html element and inherit from
       *    the parent element for everything else. This caused issues
       *    in shadow-dom-enhanced elements like <details> where the content

       *
       *    By default, the way the browser specifies that an element should have no
       *    border is by setting it's border-style to `none` in the user-agent
       *    stylesheet.
       *
       *    In order to easily add borders to elements by just setting the `border-width`
       *    property, we change the default border-style for all elements to `solid`, and
       *    use border-width to hide them instead. This way we only need to set the
       *    `border-width` property instead of the entire `border` shorthand, making our
       *    border definitions much more straightforward to compose.
